# dotfiles

Some aliases I made as well as aliases and functions I found around the web. It's a work in progress (For example, I think I need to move .bash_profile to .bashrc) but it saves me a lot of time on some tasks.

Feel free to grab anything. I think everything but coloring the day on the calendar works solidly, though much of it is tailored for my specific needs.

# Not shown
~/dotfiles can hold a projects folder which contains symlinks to all of my projects. This allows me to perform a backup of all the projects while maintaining my client's privacy by not listing them explictly in the external-backup.sh file.
